We need to simplify inlang's positioning.

## File format is primary, ecosystem is secondary

Developer's are not understanding that inlang is a file format that they can build i18n solutions on top of.

I assume that the reason is that inlang is positioned as ecosystem which is true but it's a secondary outcome of being an open file format.

Different solutions targeting the same file format = interoperability between them.

We have two personas we target on the inlang website:

1. Developer implementing i18n in their codebase in need of solutions (ecosystem approach)

2. Developers building i18n solutions (need a backend(file format))

## Localization instead of globalization 

A second issue we have is that we positoned inlang as ecosystem to go global to expand the market. But, everyone searches for i18n and localization today. We are not yet positioned to widen the market. 

Thus, we need to remove the globalization positioning in favor of "localization (i18n)" as well.

## Task

Crawl the inlang codebase, in particular the landing page and audit the current positioning.
