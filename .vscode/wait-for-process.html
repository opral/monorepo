<h2>proceed to <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a></h2>

<h3 style="color: darkred">NOTE: wait for 5-10 seconds</h3>
<p style="color: darkred">
	the server on port 3000 must be running as indicated in the terminal with
	<code>Server running at localhost:3000</code> in the terminal.
</p>

<hr />
<br />

<h4>Why is this displayed?</h4>
<p>
	For whatever reason, chrome does not load localhost:3000 if the server is not
	running. EVEN after the server has been started. A simple refresh does not
	work.
