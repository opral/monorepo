# üß¨ Lix Universal Diff

Build a diff view in your lix app with this universal differ ‚ú®

This package offers a simple way to generate and display diffs, showing users exactly what changed.

- ‚úÖ Universal: Works for anything that is rendered as HTML.
- ‚úÖ Simple: No need for renderer-specific diff logic.
- ‚úÖ Styling: Uses your existing CSS.
- ‚úÖ Works in any framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc.)

## How Does It Work? (The Rendered HTML Trick)

The core idea is to diff the *rendered HTML output* instead of source data structures given that anything is rendered as HTML anyways. This bypasses the need for custom diff implementations. 

**Legend:**

- üüß Custom development effort required
- üü© No custom development required (reusable)
- ‚ö™ Unused in the diffing process

graph TD
    subgraph "Universal Diff"
        UH_DocBefore[Before] --> UH_Renderer1[Rendered HTML]
        UH_DocAfter[After] --> UH_Renderer2[Rendered HTML]
        UH_Renderer1 --> UH_HTMLDiffer[Universal Diff Logic]
        UH_Renderer2 --> UH_HTMLDiffer
        UH_HTMLDiffer --> UH_DiffView[Diff View]
    end

    subgraph "Custom Diff"
        CB_DocBefore[Before] --> CB_Renderer1[Rendered HTML]
        CB_DocBefore --> CB_CustomDiffLogic[Custom Diff Logic]
        
        CB_DocAfter[After] --> CB_Renderer2[Rendered HTML]
        CB_DocAfter --> CB_CustomDiffLogic
        
        CB_CustomDiffLogic --> CB_Renderer[Custom Diff Renderer]
        CB_Renderer --> CB_DiffView[Diff View]
    end

    %% Styling
    style CB_CustomDiffLogic fill:orange,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:black
    style CB_Renderer fill:orange,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:black
    style UH_HTMLDiffer fill:lightgreen,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:black
    
    %% Lower opacity for unused Rendered HTML in Custom Diff but keep text black
    style CB_Renderer1 fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#aaa,stroke-width:1px,color:black,opacity:0.5
    style CB_Renderer2 fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#aaa,stroke-width:1px,color:black,opacity:0.5
```

### Comparison

#### Custom Diff Approach (üüß)

- Creates a new "diff" AST specific to what should be diffed
- Requires modifying the renderer to understand the custom diff
- One-off solution not generalizable to other document types

#### Universal Diff Approach (üü©)

- requires no adjustments from developers (!) in terms of creating a diffed AST and adjusting the renderer
- generalizes across anything that is rendered as HTML

## Usage

1. Add `data-diff-id` attributes to your rendered HTML elements.
2. Use `renderUniversalDiff` to generate a diff HTML string.
3. Display the diff HTML string in your app.

```typescript
import { renderUniversalDiff } from '@lix/universal-diff';

const beforeHtml = "<p data-diff-id='p1'>Old text.</p>";
const afterHtml = "<p data-diff-id='p1'>New text!</p><p data-diff-id='p2'>Added.</p>";

const diffHtmlString = renderUniversalDiff({ beforeHtml, afterHtml });

document.getElementById('diff-container')!.innerHTML = diffHtmlString;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

**`data-diff-id` Required:** Diff quality depends on stable `data-diff-id` attributes being present in the rendered HTML.

<summary>üß™ Development & Visual Testing</summary>

This package includes a Vite-based visual test website to help develop and debug the `renderUniversalDiff` function.

**Running the Test Website:**

1.  Ensure monorepo dependencies are installed (`pnpm install` from root).
2.  Start the dev server:

    ```bash
    # From monorepo root
    pnpm --filter universal-diff dev

    # Or from this package directory
    pnpm dev
    ```

</details>


## Styling the Diff Output

The diff renderer uses semantic CSS classes to style changes:

- `.diff-before` ‚Äî applied to elements representing removed or old content
- `.diff-after` ‚Äî applied to elements representing added or new content

### Default Styles

A default stylesheet is provided with the package:

```js
import '@lix/universal-diff/default.css';
```

Or, add it to your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/node_modules/@lix/universal-diff/default.css">
```

This file provides sensible defaults:

```css
.diff-before {
  color: red;
  text-decoration: none;
  outline: none;
}
.diff-after {
  color: green;
  text-decoration: none;
  outline: none;
}
```

You can override these styles in your own CSS for custom themes or branding:

```css
.diff-before { color: #b00; background: #fee; }
.diff-after { color: #080; background: #efe; }
```

### Merging with Existing Classes

If your original elements have classes, the diff classes will be merged (e.g. `<p class="foo diff-after">`).
