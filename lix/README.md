# Lix 

Lix is a change control system.

A change control system allows tracking, querying, and reviewing changes on arbirtary data. For example, given a spreadsheet, a change control system allows you to see who changed what and when. It also allows you to query the data at any point in time. For example, you can ask "what was the value of cell A1 on 2021-01-01?". Or given a translation file `en.json`, a query that answers the question "Who changed message with key `login-header`?" can be executed.

Examples for great lix apps have a "edit > review > automate" workflow:

- markdown editors
- bookkeeping
- editors for manuals
- figma files
- versioned spreadsheets
- CAD
- jupyter notebooks or linked datasets
- colocated bug tickets in an sqlite db in the repo
