Inlang's architecture consists of four main components:

1. [Applications](/documentation/app) - Provide users with an interface for their projects.
2. [SDK](/documentation/sdk) - Can be used by developers to build inlang apps.
3. [Project file](/documentation/manually-create-project) - Defines the project's settings, which language tags exists and to be imported modules.
4. [Modules](/documentation/plugin) - Contain plugins and/or lint rules that define the behavior of a project.
