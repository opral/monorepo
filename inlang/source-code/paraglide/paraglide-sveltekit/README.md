Paraglide JS 2.0 doesn't need the SvelteKit adapter anymore. Please use the [Paraglide JS 2.0](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs/sveltekit) directly.


## Getting Started

Get started instantly with the Paraglide-SvelteKit CLI.

```bash
npx @inlang/paraglide-sveltekit init
npm install
```

The CLI will ask you which languages you want to support. This can be changed later.

- Create an [Inlang Project](https://inlang.com/documentation/concept/project)
- Create translation files for each of your languages
- Add necessary Provider Components and files
- Update your `vite.config.js` file to use the Paraglide-SvelteKit Plugin.

You can now start your development server and visit `/de`, `/ar`, or whatever languages you've set up.

## Creating Messages

Your messages live in `messages/{languageTag}.json` files. You can add messages in these files as key-value pairs of the message ID and the translations.

Use curly braces to add parameters.

```json
// messages/en.json
{
	// The $schema key is automatically ignored
	"$schema": "https://inlang.com/schema/inlang-message-format",

	"hello_world": "Hello World!",
	"greetings": "Greetings {name}."
}
```

Learn more about the format in the [Inlang Message Format Documentation](https://inlang.com/m/reootnfj/plugin-inlang-messageFormat).

Note: _All_ messages you use in your project must be added to these files. It is not possible to dynamically add more messages at runtime.

## Using messages in Code

The Paraglide compiler will generate a `src/lib/paraglide/messages.js` file that contains your messages. Import messages from there. By convention, a wildcard import is used.

```svelte
<script>
	import * as m from '$lib/paraglide/messages.js'
</script>

<h1>{m.homepage_title()}</h1>
<p>{m.homepage_subtitle({ some: "param" })}</p>
```

Only messages used on the current page are sent to the client. Any messages that aren't used on the current page will be tree-shaken out.

##Â Accessing Language in Code

You can access the current language with the `languageTag()` function. 

```svelte
<script>
	import { languageTag } from '$lib/paraglide/runtime.js'
</script>

<h1>{languageTag()}</h1>
```

On the server `languageTag()` is scoped to the current request, there is no danger of multiple requests interfering. `languageTag()` can safely be called in server-load functions and form actions.

## Language detection 

The language is determined based on the URL. If the first segment of the URL is a language tag, that language will be used. If no language tag is present, the default language will be used.

- `/about` - English
- `/de/about` - German

The `reroute` hook in `src/hooks.js` (added automatically) automatically rewrites requests that include the language in the URL to the correct page. There is **no need** to modify your routes to add a `[locale]` segment.

```fs
src/
  routes/
	+layout.svelte
	+page.svelte
```
