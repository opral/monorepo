<Canvas of={InlangAddSelector.Example} />

#### Props:

- `bundle`: The bundle with with the declarations.
- `message`: The message where the selector should be added.

#### Event:

- `change`: The component dispatches a change event that contains all necessary information.
- `submit`: The component dispatches a submit event.

> The event bubbles up, so you can have a change event listener on a higher level.
