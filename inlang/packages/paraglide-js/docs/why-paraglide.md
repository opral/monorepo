With Paraglide's treeshakeable messages, each page only loads the messages it actually uses. Incremental loading like this would usually take forever to get right, with Paraglide you get it for free.

# Use it with your Favorite Framework

Paraglide is framework agnostic, but there are framework-specific libraries available. If there is one for your framework you will want to follow its documentation instead. If there isn't, read on.

<doc-comment text="Just tried Paraglide JS from @inlangHQ. This is how i18n should be done! Totally new level of DX for both implementation and managing translations! Superb support for SvelteKit as well ⭐" author="Patrik Engborg" icon="mdi:twitter" data-source="https://twitter.com/patrikengborg/status/1747260930873053674"></doc-comment>
<doc-comment text="I was messing with various i18n frameworks and tools in combination with Astro, and must say that Paraglide was the smoothest experience. I have migrated my website from i18next and it was a breeze. SSG and SSR worked out of the box (which was the first one for me), and overall DX is great.
