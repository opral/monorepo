# Architecture

Paraglide uses a compiler to generate JS functions from your messages. We call these "message functions".

Message Functions are fully typed and TypeScript compatible using JSDoc. They are exported individually from the `messages.js` file making them tree-shakable. When called, they return a translated string. Message functions aren't reactive in any way, if you want a translation in another language you will need to re-call them.

This design avoids many edge cases with reactivity, lazy-loading, and namespacing that other i18n libraries have to work around.

Paraglide consists of four main parts:
