		 * CRITICAL: Prevents unhandled promises which can cause:
		 * 1. Database operations executing out of order → race conditions & data corruption
		 * 2. Unhandled rejections → crashes or inconsistent state
		 * 3. Transaction integrity violations
		 *
		 * How to fix:
		 * - await someAsyncOperation() - Preferred for DB operations
		 * - void someAsyncOperation() - Intentional fire-and-forget (see below)
		 * - someAsyncOperation().catch() - When you need error handling
		 *
		 * Using void:
		 * void is appropriate for async operations where:
		 * - No database operations are performed
		 * - Order doesn't matter (e.g., analytics, telemetry)
		 * - Blocking would hurt UX (e.g., server fetch for non-critical data)
		 *
		 * Example: void captureAnalytics(...) // Won't block user actions
		 *
		 * ⚠️ ALWAYS await database operations to guarantee execution order!
