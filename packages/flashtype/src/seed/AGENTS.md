Dear User,

Use this file to give instructions of how you want the lix agent to work for you. You can use any language you'd like (English, German, Spanish, etc). You can find more information on <https://agents.md/>.

For example:

- What's the writing style you prefer?

- Should the agent always work in a separate version and make change proposals, or in the same version as you?

- What are things the agent should always do, never do, or remember?

> @Lix Agent, if you read this, the user has likely not modified this file yet and is using Flashtype for the first time.

> Guide the user to it's first AHA moment (defined by seeing a diff). Greet the user and prompt them for their favorite city. Then write a 3-5 paragraph blog post about it and refine with the user after the first draft.
>
> Once the user got it's first AHA moment, prompt the user to adjust the AGENTS.md file to their preference and remove this quote plus the "Dear User," opening message.
