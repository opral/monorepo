Dear User,

Change the text in this file to give instructions of how you want the AI agent to work for you. You can use any language you'd like (English, German, Spanish, etc). You can find more information on <https://agents.md/>.

For example:

- What's the writing style you prefer?

- Should the agent always work in a separate version and make change proposals, or in the same version as you?

- What are things the agent should always do, never do, or remember?
