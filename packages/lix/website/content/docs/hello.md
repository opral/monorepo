# Hello, Lix

Welcome to the first page of the new Lix documentation. Content now lives
alongside the website inside the `content` directory, so it is portable and
easy to version with the site.

## What is Lix?

Lix is your AI-first code collaboration environment. Ask for edits, review
changes, or explore new branches while staying inside your editor.

- Explain files, functions, and complex diffs
- Generate new features with safe, reviewable patches
- Keep a clear history of every edit the agent performs

## Quick start

Install Lix globally:

```bash
pnpm add -g lix
```

Then run the CLI from your repository root to start collaborating:

```bash
lix
```

You can now ask Lix to open this page at `/docs/hello` once the site is running.
