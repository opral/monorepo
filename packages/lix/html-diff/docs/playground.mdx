# Playground

Try the HTML diff tool in real-time! Paste your "before" and "after" HTML to see how the diff would look.
Make sure to include [`data-diff-key`](/guide/attributes.html#data-diff-key) attributes for elements you want to track changes for.

You can also use these optional attributes to control diffing behavior:
- [`data-diff-mode="words"`](/guide/attributes.html#words) - Enable word-level diffing within elements
- [`data-diff-mode="element"`](/guide/attributes.html#element) - Use atomic element-level diffing
- [`data-diff-show-when-removed`](/guide/attributes.html#data-diff-show-when-removed) - Show removed elements with strikethrough styling
