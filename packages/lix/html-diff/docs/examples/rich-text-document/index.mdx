# Rich Text Document

This example demonstrates HTML diff with a rich text document created using [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) ([Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/)). The document contains structured content with interactive elements, styled components, and complex nested HTML structures typical of modern rich text editors.

import Showcase from "../../components/showcase";
import beforeHtml from "./before.html?raw";
import afterHtml from "./after.html?raw";
import showcaseCSS from "./styles.css?raw";

<Showcase before={beforeHtml} after={afterHtml} css={showcaseCSS} />
