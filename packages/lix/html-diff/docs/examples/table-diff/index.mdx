# Table Diff

This example demonstrates how `data-diff-key` preserves table structure while highlighting changes. Notice how only `data-diff-status` attributes are added to cells—no new elements are inserted that would break the table layout.

import Showcase from "../../components/showcase";
import beforeHtml from "./before.html?raw";
import afterHtml from "./after.html?raw";
import showcaseCSS from "./styles.css?raw";

<Showcase before={beforeHtml} after={afterHtml} css={showcaseCSS} />
