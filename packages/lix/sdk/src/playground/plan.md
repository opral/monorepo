# Playground Notes

## Todos

- [ ] real entity views creation upon insert of schema defintion
- [ ] make all tests pass without any preprocessor being active (vtable has to build query without relying on vtable itself again) 
- [ ] implement with no preprocessor simulation to ensure preprocessor is just an optimization
- [ ] implement pipeline stages
  - [ ] normalize placeholders
  - [ ] expand views
  - [ ] rewrite vtable selects
  - [ ] cache populator

## Pipeline

0. Normalize placeholders

- convert `?` or named parameters to numbered placeholders (`?1`, `?2`, â€¦) as the very first step so downstream stages can reference parameter-bound predicates reliably.

1. Expand views

- do not rewrite. just expand views in place.
- do not hoist. keep things inline to avoid dependencies between statements.

```sql
-- incoming query
SELECT
    "column_a",
    "column_b"
FROM "test_schema"
WHERE "column_a" = 'hello'
  AND "lixcol_version_id" = 'global';

-- step expand sql (inline view, predicates still outside)
SELECT
    "column_a",
    "column_b"
FROM (
    SELECT
        "entity_id" AS "lixcol_id",
        json_extract("snapshot_content", '$.column_a') AS "column_a",
        json_extract("snapshot_content", '$.column_b') AS "column_b",
        "version_id" AS "lixcol_version_id",
        "created_at" AS "lixcol_created_at",
        "updated_at" AS "lixcol_updated_at"
    FROM "lix_internal_state_vtable"
    WHERE "schema_key" = 'test_schema'
) AS "test_schema"
WHERE "column_a" = 'hello'
  AND "lixcol_version_id" = 'global';
```

2. Rewrite vtable selects

- parse and analyze expanded query for vtable rewrites
- provide the step context with a cache preflight (version + schema_key) that are used in the rewrite

```sql
-- step rewrite vtable select (cache swap + predicate pushdown)
SELECT
    "column_a",
    "column_b"
FROM (
    SELECT
        "entity_id" AS "lixcol_id",
        json_extract("snapshot_content", '$.column_a') AS "column_a",
        json_extract("snapshot_content", '$.column_b') AS "column_b",
        "version_id" AS "lixcol_version_id",
        "created_at" AS "lixcol_created_at",
        "updated_at" AS "lixcol_updated_at"
    FROM (
        WITH RECURSIVE
            "params" AS (
                SELECT 'global' AS "version_id"
            ),
            "state_candidates" AS (
                SELECT
                    "cache"."entity_id",
                    "cache"."schema_key",
                    "cache"."snapshot_content",
                    "cache"."created_at",

                    "cache"."version_id",
                    "cache"."version_id" AS "resolved_version_id",
                    NULL AS "inherited_from_version_id",

3. Cache populator

- consumes the cache preflight info from the vtable rewrite step
- populates the cache as needed prior to executing the rewritten query
