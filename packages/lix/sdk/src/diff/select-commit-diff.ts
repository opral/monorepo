/**
 * Compare two commits and return differences between their leaf entity states.
 *
 * Reconstructs entity states at each commit by walking commit ancestry, then compares them.
 * Unlike version-based diffs, this dynamically computes states without requiring version materialization.
 *
 * Diff status meanings:
 *
 * - `added`: Entity exists only in `after` commit
 * - `removed`: Entity exists only in `before` commit
 * - `modified`: Entity exists in both with different change_ids
 * - `unchanged`: Entity exists in both with same change_id
 *
 * Uses fast-path optimization when `includeUnchanged: false` (default) by first identifying
 * changed entity triples, then only reconstructing leaf states for those.
 *
 * The `hints` parameter filters results at the database level for better performance:
 *
 * - `includeUnchanged`: Include unchanged entities (default: true). Set false for fast-path optimization.
 * - `fileId`: Limit to specific file
 * - `pluginKey`: Filter by plugin that created changes
 * - `schemaKeys`: Include only specific entity types
 * - `entityIds`: Include only specific entities
 *
 * @example
 * // Get changes between commits
 * const changes = await selectCommitDiff({
 *   lix,
 *   before: 'abc123',
 *   after: 'xyz789',
 *   hints: { includeUnchanged: false }
 * }).execute();
 *
 * @example
 * // Filter by file and status
 * const fileDiff = await selectCommitDiff({ lix, before, after })
 *   .where('diff.file_id', '=', 'messages.json')
 *   .where('diff.status', '!=', 'unchanged')
 *   .execute();
