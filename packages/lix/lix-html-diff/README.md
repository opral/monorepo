# Lix HTML Diff

Lix HTML Diff is a simple way to generate and display diffs for any app UI.

- üåê **Universal**: Works for any app that renders to HTML (which is most apps!)
- ‚ö° **Simple**: No need for renderer-specific diff logic.
- üé® **Uses your styles**: Uses your existing CSS.
- üîß **Framework Agnostic**: Works with React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, and more.

Assume you want to diff a table that's displayed to users. You render the before and after HTML, then pass both into the `renderHtmlDiff` function to get the diff:

```typescript
import { renderHtmlDiff } from "@lix-js/html-diff";

const tableBefore = renderTable(beforeData);
const tableAfter = renderTable(afterData);

const diff = renderHtmlDiff({ 
  beforeHtml: tableBefore, 
  afterHtml: tableAfter 
});

render(diff, document.getElementById("diff-container"));
```
