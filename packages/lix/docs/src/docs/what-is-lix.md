# What is Lix?

Lix is an embeddable change control system that enables Git-like features such as [history](/docs/history), [versions](/docs/versions) (branches), [diffs](/docs/diffs), or [blame](/docs/attribution) for any file format.

What makes lix unique:

- **Supports any file format** - Like JSON, CSV, Excel etc. via plugins.
- **Embedded** - Runs as part of your application with no separate database, server, or process.
- **SDK-first** - Programmatic APIs for versioning, change propsoals, diffs, history, and merge workflows.

_Read more on how Lix's change control compares to traditional version control systems like Git [here](/docs/comparison-to-git)._

## Use Cases

- **AI Agent sandboxing:** Agents propose changes, humans review and approve before applying.
- **Applications with change control:** Branch/merge-style reviews, audit trails, and versioning for structured data.
