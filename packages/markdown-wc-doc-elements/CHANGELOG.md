### Minor Changes

- 1f50c49: refactor: dual bundle dist output and index exports

  the output of the dist folder now includes bundled components that can be imported in the browser as well as the index.js file that exports the components for apps that are responsible for bundling the components themselves.

- 015da74: Separate the markdown-wc-doc-elements package from the markdown-wc package. This package provides a set of custom elements that can be used to write (technical) documentation.
