# Inlang Environment

This service is a custom inlang environment based on the requirements of VSCode.

The need for a custom environment stems from the fact that VSCode doesn't support ESM. The lack of ESM support in VSCode is caused by lacking ESM support in Electron. Issue https://github.com/inlang/inlang/issues/452 provides more details.
