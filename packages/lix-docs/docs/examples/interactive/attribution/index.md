# Attribution Interactive Examples

Attribution shows who made changes to your data and when. These interactive examples demonstrate how to query and display attribution information for different scenarios.

## Selected Entity Attribution

Find out who authored a change for a selected entity. This is useful for implementing "blame" functionality in your application.

<LixSandpack feature="attribution" example="attribution-selected-entity" height="800px" fullWidth />

## File Change Attribution

Query attribution for file-level changes. This shows how to track changes at the file level rather than individual entities.

<LixSandpack feature="attribution" example="attribution-file-change" height="800px" fullWidth />
