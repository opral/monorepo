# Attribution Interactive Examples

Attribution shows who made changes to your data and when. These interactive examples demonstrate how to query and display attribution information for different scenarios.

## Entity Attribution Query

Find out who authored a change for a selected entity. This is useful for implementing "blame" functionality in your application.

## File Change Attribution

Query attribution for file-level changes. This shows how to track changes at the file level rather than individual entities.
