## 🌐 About inlang

**inlang is a whole ecosystem** of building blocks for your globalization (internationalization / i18n) efforts with the goal of helping companies to enter new markets in no time. For example:

- use [inlang paraglide-js](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs) to have a fully translated, typesafe & fast app in minutes
- use the [inlang VSCode extension](https://inlang.com/m/r7kp499g/app-inlang-ideExtension) to translate your app right in the editor
- use the [inlang Web Edtior](https://inlang.com/m/tdozzpar/app-inlang-editor) to translate your app in the browser & invite collaborators to help you
- use the [inlang CLI](https://inlang.com/m/2qj2w8pu/app-inlang-cli) to lint your messsages with lint rules or machine translate them & have quality control in CI/CD
- *build your own app / plugin / lint rule* with the [inlang SDK](https://inlang.com/documentation/architecture)
- ...
