# Please open feature requests in [the discussions](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/discussions/categories/feedback) instead.

Opening a discussion instead of an issue allows to:

1. separate "issues" (TODOs) from feature requests
2. voting of feature requests
3. discussing the implementation
