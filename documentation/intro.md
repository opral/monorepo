Headers
-------

There are two ways to define headers:

The biggest possible header
===========================

# You can also use this markup

(I prefer the first one as it's more readable when looking directly at the source code)
 
A sub heading
-------------
 
## This is the alternative format

### Then you can go smaller

#### And smaller

##### And even smaller

###### No, you can't go smaller than this
