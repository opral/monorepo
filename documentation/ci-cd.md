**Inlang being file and git-based (read the [design-principles](/documentation/design-principles)) entails the possbility to leverage CI/CD to automate localization.**

Similar to [building entire apps on inlang](/documentation/build-on-inlang), the [@inlang/core](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/tree/main/source-code/core) package can be used to create CI/CD automations.
